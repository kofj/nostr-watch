# nostr-watch 0.2

A client-side nostr network status built with Vue3, Pinia, [nostr-tools](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-tools), [nostr-js](https://github.com/jb55/nostr-js) and [nostrwatch-js](https://github.com/dskvr/nostrwatch-js). Originally forked from [fiatjaf/nostr-relay-registry](http://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-relay-registry) but ended up being a rewrite.

nostr.watch aggregates data on nostr relays and the network in general to assist users, developers and relay operators. 

Develop branch is deployed to https://next.nostr.watch

## Relay Additions 
It is now suggested to add relays simply by using them and publishing your kind 3 to really any known relay in good health. Most of the relays are discovered at runtime. This change is not yet communicated in production. 

Relay additions via Github as the primary method of adding relays will be phased out for a number of reasons, expect this change with the `0.2` release.

If you are adding a relay, you need to use `main` as your base and submit your pr into `main`. Submissions to `develop` will still be approved, but your relay will not go online until a release. Whereas a PR into `main` will go live within 10 minutes of being merged. 

PRs into `develop` will not recieve any notification about this requirement.
